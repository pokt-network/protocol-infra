## Private PNI infrastructure

Although the Protocol team develops software in public and all code is open-source, we still utilize private infrastructure that belongs to PNI.

Core team members should refer to the internal documentation on how to gain access and related information [in Notion](https://www.notion.so/buildwithgrove/Infrastructure-Setup-79b1431b70374e24b10cd9da556c7645?pvs=4).
