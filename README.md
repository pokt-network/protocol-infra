## Private PNI infrastructure

Although the Protocol team develops software in public and all code is open-source, we still utilize private infrastructure that belongs to PNI.

Core team members should refer to the internal documentation on how to gain access and related information [in Notion](https://www.notion.so/pocketnetwork/V1-networks-7d95c10c930c45c3823c871f21d44fca?pvs=4).
